This is a music visualizer!  

What it basically does is the following: it allows users to search songs from Youtube and visualize the beat into the screen.

The search function shows the top viewed videos and returns them to the modal frame.

Have fun with it and please leave comments on our page!

We had some difficulties making our project compatible to mobile webapps.(ex. safari/ chrome mobile)

If possible, use the site on full screen!
